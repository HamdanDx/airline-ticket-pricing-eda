# Exploratory Analysis of Airline Ticket Pricing Factors ✈️

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on airline ticket
pricing to understand how various factors influence fare variations.
The analysis focuses on identifying pricing patterns driven by airline type,
travel class, booking timing, flight schedules, and route characteristics.

## Objectives
- Analyze how ticket prices vary across airlines and travel classes
- Examine the impact of departure and arrival time on pricing
- Understand route-level and city-based price variations
- Explore the effect of last-minute bookings on ticket prices
- Identify demand-driven pricing behavior in Business class routes

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on airline flights, including:
- Airline
- Travel class (Economy, Business)
- Source and destination cities
- Departure and arrival time categories
- Number of days left before departure
- Ticket price

## Tools & Libraries
- **Pandas** – data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – exploratory data visualization

## Key Insights
- Business class tickets are significantly more expensive than Economy class,
  highlighting strong service-level price segmentation.
- Ticket prices increase as the departure date approaches, indicating
  dynamic and last-minute pricing behavior.
- Peak travel periods (evening and night) generally have higher average prices.
- Major metropolitan hubs such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad
  show higher average fares due to stronger demand.
- Business class pricing varies notably across major airline routes,
  reflecting route-specific and airline-specific pricing strategies.

## Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates that airline ticket pricing is influenced by multiple
interacting factors, including airline positioning, class of service,
travel timing, booking window, and route demand.
These insights can support better pricing strategy analysis and
data-driven decision-making in the aviation domain.
